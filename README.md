How to get MySQL database connected to Vaadin start.vaadin.com project
=================================================================

This tutorial mainly concentrates on how to wire your Vaadin web application to `MySQL` database so you can Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) information in database via `Vaadin` web application. Idea is to show you how to connect a template downloaded from https://start.vaadin.com to a database so you can replicate it to your own needs. This is not about the best practices (for `Vaadin`, `Spring` or `MySQL`) but to get you started fast.
